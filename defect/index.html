        >Defect coffee shop, 2020, Moscow</p>
        While working in the coffee industry, the artist used to say that in
        order to open a coffee shop, it was enough to find a busy place and a
        convenient surface, like a window sill, or, as in this case, a trash
        can. It was under such circumstances at the dumpster in the passageway
        between a cafe and the back entrance to an Armenian restaurant that she
        set up the Defect coffee shop. While selecting what kind of coffee to
        brew in such conditions, the artist turned to roasting ventures for
        'defective' coffee beans with various flaws. Such coffee may not be
        tasted in a coffee shop, it is already too poor to brew, but for
        whatever reason has not yet made it to the trash.
        <p>
          Such an approach to the selection of beans not only demonstrates
          respect for the product, but also for the environment, allowing the
          use of materials that might otherwise be disposed of. In this way, the
          rejected product becomes unique and is treated with care and solemnity
          during the preparation process. During the event, several pieces of
          music were played at the same time. The sounds from multiple sources,
          which created the effect of noise and musical mess, helped to immerse
          the guests in unfamiliar circumstances and to subvert their notion of
          normal and defective conditions. A place that is usually repulsive
          became a social platform for like-minded people to interact and
          allowed them to think about both what is valuable and what is
          defective, and to expand the audience's taste experience.
