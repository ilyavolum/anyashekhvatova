          collection of inedible desserts, moscow, 2020
        </p>
        This collection of inedible desserts was created to keep the tradition
        of coffee shops where drinking coffee with sugar or dessert is
        considered disrespectful to the product, as it obscures its natural
        sweetness. To remain a part of this tradition, but still serve desserts,
        the artist decided to create inedible desserts, realistically made of
        colored molding dough with texture very pleasant to the touch, but not
        suitable for eating. The dessert was served on a plate with a fork and
        knife. Each dessert had one of three flavors (cedar, lime, spruce)
        chosen by the artist to pair with the coffee. In this way, this
        collection of inedible desserts may represent a new way of perceiving
        food and provoke a deeper emotional experience for the guests. The
        collection featured 21 desserts.
