            Anya Shekhvatova's work Kaffa is a site-specific installation with
            elements of performance that took place in a defunct cinema, once a
            hub for collective dreaming where individual boundaries and
            perception were blurred. At the heart of the installation is an
            artistic juxtaposition of a slow coffee ceremony and the traditional
            Circassian dance known as Kafa. This slow and graceful dance is a
            homage to Anya's childhood spent surrounded by Circassian culture
            and a symbolic farewell to its customs and traditions.
            <p>
              The installation explores the themes of duality and the potential
              to overcome boundaries through the use of sound and movement. The
              slow coffee ceremony mimics the graceful movements of the Kaffa
              dance and the traditional costumes of the dancer, sharing this
              resemblance with the building's architecture, thus creating a
              harmonious balance and adding to the hermetic nature of the piece.
              Not limited to just sight and sound, Anya employs a range of
              media, including traditional elements and new technologies, as
              well as smell to create a multi-sensory immersive experience for
              the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The slow, deliberate movements of the ceremony and the sensory
              stimuli of the coffee are designed to provoke a meditative state
              and encourage introspection in the viewer, inviting to to
              experience the state of absolute fluidity from which objects and
              meanings emerge. By combining elements of the past and present,
              the work also considers the deeper connections that exist between
              cultural heritage and the modern world, creating a self- contained
              speculative narrative. Sound by Egor Gusev.
