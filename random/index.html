          random coffee experiments, moscow, 2019-2020
        </p>
        The random coffee experiment practices aim to explore taste as a
        phenomenon, its place in our memory and life, and the influence one's
        life and experience have on the taste preferences and appreciations. The
        experiments were a series of 7 events with a total of over 150
        individual tastings. They were conducted according to the artist's
        script, in specifically prepared venues. The conditions in which the
        artist conducts the tastings aimed at reinforcing focus on the
        perception of taste. The task of the experiments was to reveal the
        connections between the sense of taste, in particular coffee, and the
        memory and personal experience of the visitor. In the experiments, the
        participants were asked to evaluate the aroma, taste, and aftertaste of
        the brew based on atypical synaesthetic categories of color, texture,
        and shape. This approach allowed the audience to look at the product
        they were consuming through the eyes of the artist, in particular to
        notice something special about their perception of coffee and to apply
        this tasting method to other products or aspects of life. The artist
        collected a library of intolerable coffee descriptors from her
        experiments. And using this particular example, she was able to conclude
        that people sense inedible descriptors in edible products.
