        This project to reveal the connections between the spiritual and the
        material. Making her dream come true, Anya opened 420 coffeeshop, which
        worked until 420 cups of coffee were made. The artist served each cup
        with a numbered stone. Through the tactile interaction with the stone
        the participant was invited to connect with his unconscious and make a
        wish, thereby immersing the audience in the environment of his thoughts
        and spiritual world.<br />
        The stone becomes an artifact that stays with the participant until a
        wish is made, after which the process of wish fulfillment is triggered.
        The project shows the connection between spiritual and physical reality,
        where the cognitive reality is harmoniously complemented by the physical
        reality of action.
