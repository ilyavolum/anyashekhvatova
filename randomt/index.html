          An ongoing nomadic project started in 2018 against the backdrop of the
          rave culture, in collaboration with the artist Dasha Mamba.
          Essentially, it is a pop-up cafe (executed over a hundred times), with
          its menu structured around tea and designed as a way to connect with
          yourself and thoughtfully relive the rave experience-concentrated,
          exalted, and perhaps even aggressive.
          <p>
            The tea acts as a conduit into a particular state of caring and
            adjusts the focus of the tearoom guest's attention. Apart from her
            interaction with taste, the artist also uses aromas, sounds,
            textures, and visuals to create the tearoom space in order to engage
            all the senses and immerse the viewer deeper into the moment. The
            tearoom is a fluid space-more of a feeling than an environment. It
            fits into the context of a particular place and event, absorbs it
            and with it, comes to an end. To reveal itself next time in another
            guise at another event. Together with a cup of tea the artist
            suggests a complex experience, through which one connects first with
            oneself, and then adjusts the focus to the surrounding reality.<br />

          A tearoom, located in a basement with black walls, ceiling, and floor
          to create a sense of cosmos. The velvet curtains, and shiny small
          mirrors added fluidity, a dripping transparent slime, while the
          levitating candles deepened the feeling of weightlessness. Smoky aroma
          sticks scented with nagchampa flowers and various optical illusions
          created an elegant neo-witchy dark 'pocket' to hide in with a cup of
          hot tea.
