            Still life coffee situation, <br />Cyprus, Limassol,<br />
            December 2021
          </p>
          The goal of this project was to investigate the phenomenon of
          synaesthesia and the importance of taste in our memory. Synaesthesia
          is a condition when one sensory input (e.g., taste) triggers
          perception in other sensory areas (e.g., vision.) Research shows that
          synesthesia is associated with a specific type of perception that can
          be useful for creative thinking.
          <p>
            In this event the artist made 4 kinds of coffee and described their
            taste through a series of still lifes. The group of participants
            were asked to draw the compositions (or depict the taste in their
            own way) using free technique on paper and digitally. Each still
            life was displayed for 20 minutes, after which a new kind of coffee
            and a corresponding still life were created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still lifes were created from different objects and textures,
            representing the perception of a certain kind of coffee, according
            to its taste. For example, the bitter and pungent Cypriot coffee in
            the still life was represented as a tiger, teaspoons filled with
            earth and a porcelain hand holding a smoldering paper.
